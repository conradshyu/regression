Synopsis:
=========
This archive contains the implementation of polynomial regression for estimates
of free energy differences using thermodynamic integration. It also contains an
example data file to jumpstart use of the software. The implementation makes
heavy use of STL (standard template library) which requires a C++ compiler.
This program is self-contained and should not require any additional libraries.

To compile the program, simply type:

make

The make program will invoke the Makefile and compiles the source code.
Alternatively, to compile the files manually, issue the command:

g++ -I. driver.cpp regress.cpp -o regress -lm

The archive lists three implementation files and an example file.

Filename        Descriptions
------------    -----------------------------
driver.cpp      the user interface program
regress.cpp     the main implementation of polynomial regression
regress.h       the header file for polynomial regression
example.csv     example file of simulations data from thermodynamic integration
Makefile        the makefile to compile the source code
readme.txt      this file

The purpose of this program is to construct a regression model that optimally
fits the thermodynamic integration data. The implementation also contains an
estimate function that allows the interpolating polynomial be used to
extrapolate points. This feature may be useful to determine the accuracy of the
regression model.

The polynomial regression program takes four command-line parameters:
input_file, degree [optional], plot_file [optional], and data_points [optional].
Only one parameter, the input file, is required to run the software. The
followings detail the format and meaning of each command-line parameter.

input_file
----------
The input file must be saved in the plain text format. The first column contains
the lambda values and second the ensemble averages from the simulations. Each
column of data must be separated by either a comma or a white space. For example,
the followings list the contents of the example input file:

0.0,  51.49866347
0.1,  23.92508775
0.2,  10.35390700
0.3,   2.58426990
0.4,  -2.18351656
0.5,  -5.41745387
0.6,  -7.62452181
0.7,  -9.25455804
0.8, -10.45592989
0.9, -11.39244138
1.0, -12.12433704

To run the analysis program with the required parameter, type:

regress example.csv

The program will output the interpolating polynomial and the estimate of free
energy using the Lagrange interpolating polynomial and trapezoidal rule. For
example, the example file should generate the following output:

Degree, Coefficients
     0,      51.49866347
     1,    -440.06771988
     2,    2724.49944200
     3,  -16355.52325204
     4,   74074.45611540
     5, -226406.51705359
     6,  454849.19406749
     7, -590543.95494381
     8,  476225.01322752
     9, -216633.75369268
    10,   42443.03080908

Free energy difference
 Lagrange: 0.65644834
Trapezoid: 1.02220063

degree
------
This parameter specifies the degree of polynomial for the regression model.
This parameter is optional. If this parameter is not specified, the program
will determine the degree of polynomial based on the number of data points, up
to the degree of ten. For example, to run the analysis with a polynomial of
degree eight, type

regress example.csv 8

Alternatively, to run the analysis with the maximum degree of polynomial, type

regress example.csv

plot_file
---------
This parameter specifies the name of the file that contains the estimates
obtained from the interpolating polynomial. This parameter is optional. If this
parameter is not given, no plot data will be generated by the program. For
example, to generate a file of plot data with the default number of data points
extrapolated from the interpolating polynomial, issue the command:

regress example.csv 10 plot.csv

The file, example.csv, is the input file that contains the thermodynamic
integration data. The numerical value, 10, specifies the degree of polynomial.
To generate a plot, it is necessary to specify the degree of polynomial for the
regression model. The file, plot.csv, is the output file that contains the
estimates from the interpolating polynomial.

data_points
-----------
This parameter specifies the number of data points extrapolated from the
polynomial. This parameter is optional. If this parameter is not given, the
number of data points will be the same as the input file. For example, to
generate a file of plot data with 100 data points extrapolated from the
polynomial, issue the command:

regress example.csv 10 plot.csv 100
